0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
====================================

This project is part of the Alx - SE curriculum of software engineering. The main objective is to understand and implement the concepts of sorting algorithms and Big O notation.

Team Members:
-------------
- Abdallah Abdelrahman
- Mohannad Babeker

Learning Objectives
-------------------
- Understand what the Big O notation is and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
- Learn how the following sorting algorithms work:
    - Bubble sort
    - Insertion sort
    - Selection sort
    - Quick sort
    - Shell sort - Knuth Sequence
    - Cocktail shaker sort
    - Counting sort
    - Merge sort
    - Heap sort
    - Radix sort
    - Bitonic sort
    - Quick Sort - Hoare Partition scheme
- Understand how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
- Learn what a stable sorting algorithm is.

More Info
---------
For this project, we are given the following print_array, and print_list functions:

- print_array.c
- print_list.c

Our file sort.h will contain all the function prototypes and data structures.
